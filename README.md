# Hot Mass

This site has been developed for the band ‘*Hot Mass*’ in order to display the band to prospective management and distributors as well as potential new fans. 

Hot Mass are a band from Swansea, South Wales who are releasing their much anticipated sophomore full feature length album, ‘*Happy, Smiling and Living the Dream*’. 

The site will be focused on displaying information about the band, their previous releases, upcoming shows, where to purchase merchandise, and how to get in touch with the band directly through various channels. 

This site will be ideal for anyone wanting to get any info they need concerning all things ‘Hot Mass’. 

### Features

This page will include features which will enable prospective agencies to find out what they need to know about ‘*Hot Mass*’. 

It is aimed at clients who would be willing to add ‘*Hot Mass*’ to their artist rosters, so detailing of upcoming shows won’t be necessary as it’s the other aspects of the band’s business side that will need to be addressed. 

The ideal goal for the band is to have a prospective client/agency move forward with their intention of signing the band to their roster. They want to be able to do this by detailing the necessary information that agencies like to see a band working on, previous music releases, new music releases, videos, merchandise for sale, and a general idea of what the band is and who they are sonically. 

# Navigation



## Landing page 



When first navigating to the page the user is given a single page. A simple colour scheme is incorporated to make it more visually appealing with clear contrast between text and background colour. 

### Navigation Bar

![](https://i.ibb.co/9n5JcPX/Screen-Shot-2021-06-05-at-11-47-43.png)

The Nav bar is fixed to the top of the page when scrolling to ensure that access to any section within the page is within one click. 

The user is also given the option of an external press pack download in PDF form which collates the information on the page if they wish to save a copy for themselves rather than scrolling through the page. This navigates to a new browser window to ensure that the user still stays on the landing page once closed. 

### Features

Every navigation link brings the user to a new section of the website. 

Each navigation link has a hover feature to ensure that the user knows which link they're interacting with. 

### Landing page image

![Landing Page Image](https://i.ibb.co/2sRp0W2/Screen-Shot-2021-06-05-at-11-47-30.png)

The image used is a large version of the bands logo hosted externally with a transparent background to eliminate any white backgrounds from the image file existing. 

The colours featured in the logo image are what constitute the colour scheme used throughout the website. 
This allows for continuity and familiarity especially aestetically. 

## Footer 



The footer is placed at the very bottom of the page with an absolute position to ensure that it stays at the bottom. 

### Features 

The footer includes a text version of the bands name in the same font used in the logo image, to allow for extra branding and continuity. 

Social media links are included in the footer to allow the user to navigate to the appropriate social media sites, each one has the same hover feature as the nav bar to ensure the user knows which link they're interacting with. 

Each one brings the user to a new browser window once clicked, to ensure that once closed the user returns to the website. 


## The Band page

The band section includes information about the band as well as an interactive gallery featuring javascript to make for an easier navigation and interaction when clicking the images. 

### Scrolling pictures


The gallery when displayed on larger screen sizes includes smaller thumbnails of the other images included, once the site is loaded onto devices with smaller screens, the thumbnails are no longer displayed as they become disruptive if they're included at a size which is distinguishable. 

Removing them means that the user experiences a much more aestetically pleasing visit without having to change the screen orientation or zoom in to identify what the pictures are without interacting with them, they simply need to use the navigation 'Next' and 'Previous' arrow buttons located on the left and right of the image displayed within the gallery.
